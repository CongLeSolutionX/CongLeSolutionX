<h1 align="center">Hi 👋,<br/>I'm Cong Le</h1>
<p align="center"><q>Just a regular kid <br/>love mixing digital art and AI models<br/> to build things <br/>as a hobby and for my little humble academic research.</q><br/>
Please accept my apologies if my phrasing was unclear or caused offense.<br/>🙏🙏🙏
</p>

<h3 align="center">Chance led me to iOS development, <br> <ins>but the COVID-19 pandemic cemented my choice of a software engineering career</ins><br/>(<ins>this is my real personal experience and timeframe, not carry any figurative meanings</ins>), <br> which I stay current with through my writing on this platform,<br/> and <s>sometimes</s> occasionally on Medium</h3>

- 🔭 My current focus is a natural-language processing iOS app, <ins>which is used to be the capstone project for my humble Master's degree</ins>, ~which concluded in June 2025~ and the initial work is finally in this [repo](https://github.com/CongLeSolutionX/On_device_real_time_AI_assistant),...I'm <ins>**slowly and unfrequently**</ins> setting up the <ins>CI/CD strategy</ins> for this project...
- 📝 I publish articles on iOS development and its integration with AI tools ~sometimes~ occasionally on [Medium.com/@CongLeSolutionX](https://www.medium.com/@CongLeSolutionX), <ins>where still hosting my older tech articles</ins>, ~~which, in turn, might remain deprecated features~~, focusing on the technical concepts and components I use in my capstone project.
- <ins>The majority of my technical writings and latest updates</ins> will be on this platform. My writing covers various topics, from Swift and Objective-C to machine learning, edge computing, <ins>**algorithms**</ins>, <ins>**maths**</ins>, IoT, <ins>**AI**</ins>, NLP, etc.

     I believe the best way to learn is by studying the work of others.<br/>
     This is reflected in my many forked repos, which have been instrumental to my growth as a developer.<br/>
     My focus now is shifting from absorbing knowledge to contributing back. You can see my own contributions and active projects pinned on my profile.<br/>
     My intention was always to learn, never to misrepresent the incredible work of others.<br/>
     Moving forward, I'm being more intentional about my public contributions.<br/>
     🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
