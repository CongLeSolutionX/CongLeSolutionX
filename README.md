<h3 align="center">Chance led me to iOS development, <br> <ins>but the COVID-19 pandemic cemented my choice of a software engineering career</ins><br/>(<ins>this is my real personal experience and timeframe, not carry any figurative meanings</ins>), <br> which I stay current with through my writing on GitHub platform,<br/> and <s>sometimes</s> occasionally on Medium𓂃🖊📱</h3>

- 🔭 My current focus is a natural-language processing iOS app, <ins>which is used to be the capstone project for my humble Master's program</ins>, ~which concluded in June 2025~ and the initial work is finally in this [repo](https://github.com/CongLeSolutionX/On_device_real_time_AI_assistant),...*I'm <ins>**slowly and unfrequently**</ins> setting up the <ins>CI/CD strategy</ins> for this project since <ins>my top priority is landing a tech job now</ins>*...👨🏼‍💻🏗🧠🤖
- 📝 I publish articles on iOS development and its integration with AI tools ~sometimes~ occasionally on [Medium.com/@CongLeSolutionX](https://www.medium.com/@CongLeSolutionX), <ins>where still hosting my older tech articles</ins>, ~~which, in turn, might remain deprecated features~~, focusing on the technical concepts and components I use in my capstone project.
- <ins>The majority of my technical writings and latest updates</ins> will be on this platform. My writing covers various topics, from Swift and Objective-C to machine learning, edge computing, <ins>**algorithms**</ins>, <ins>**maths**</ins>, IoT, <ins>**AI**</ins>, NLP, etc.·········♾️ ᝰ.ᐟ

- 💬 Currently, the pursuit of understanding the (<ins>potentially</ins>) <b>mysterious connections and relationships</b> among the projects below <ins>as personal interests and self-studying</ins> ~is all-consuming, frequently keeping me working from dusk 🌄 till dawn 🌅~ is temporary on pause since I need more time on hunting a job.<br/>Help me out if anyone knows any companies currently hiring! 🙏🙏🙏
