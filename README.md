<h1 align="center">Hi 👋,<br/>I'm Cong Le</h1>
<p align="center"><q>Just a regular kid <br/>love mixing digital art and AI models<br/> to build things <br/>as a hobby and for my little humble academic research.</q><br/>
Please accept my apologies if my phrasing was unclear or caused offense.<br/>🙏🙏🙏
</p>

<h3 align="center">Chance led me to iOS development, <br> <ins>but the COVID-19 pandemic cemented my choice of a software engineering career</ins><br/>(<ins>this is my real personal experience and timeframe, not carry any figurative meanings</ins>), <br> which I stay current with through my writing on this platform,<br/> and <s>sometimes</s> occasionally on other platforms.</h3>

- 🔭 My current focus is a natural-language processing iOS app, <ins>which is used to be the capstone project for my humble Master's degree</ins>, ~which concluded~ and the initial work is finally in this [repo](https://github.com/CongLeSolutionX/On_device_real_time_AI_assistant),...I'm <ins>**slowly and unfrequently**</ins> setting up the <ins>CI/CD strategy</ins> for this project...
- 📝 I publish articles on iOS development and its integration with AI tools ~sometimes~ occasionally on Medium, <ins>where still hosting my older tech articles</ins>, ~~which, in turn, might remain deprecated features~~, focusing on the technical concepts and components I use in my capstone project.
- <ins>The majority of my technical writings and latest updates</ins> will be on this platform. My writing covers various topics, from Swift and Objective-C to machine learning, edge computing, <ins>**algorithms**</ins>, <ins>**maths**</ins>, IoT, <ins>**AI**</ins>, NLP, etc.

  As a visual learner student, I created these personal study notes from the cited source(s) to aid my understanding.<br/>
  While my firm intention is to provide full credit, the blended format of notes and diagrams may sometimes obscure the original source, for which I apologize.<br/>
  I am committed to making corrections and welcome any feedback.<br/>
  This is a non-commercial project for my humble educational purposes only since the start.<br/>
  My goal is to share my perspective and contribute to the great work already being done.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I want to extend my genuine apologies to the creators of the original material.<br/>
  Their work was the direct inspiration for some of my projects, and I adapted it without first reaching out.<br/>
  My intent comes from a place of deep respect, and I hope this is received in the spirit of homage.<br/>

     I believe the best way to learn is by studying the work of others.<br/>
     This is reflected in my many forked repos, which have been instrumental to my growth as a developer.<br/>
     My focus now is shifting from absorbing knowledge to contributing back. You can see my own contributions and active projects pinned on my profile.<br/>
     My intention was always to learn, never to misrepresent the incredible work of others.<br/>
     Moving forward, I'm being more intentional about my public contributions.<br/>
     🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

    This should be a very difficult but necessary decision.<br/>
    Starting today, July 30, 2025, I will be stepping back from creating new content on this platform and others for the foreseeable future.<br/>
    The only activity you might see from my account on this platform will be the removal of old forked repositories that I have not personally participated in or contributed to. This is simply part of an effort to clean up my digital footprint.<br/>
    This broader decision to step back comes from a need to prevent my name and username from being used for malicious activities online. By pausing my own content, I hope to make any fraudulent accounts more visible.<br/>
    I would be incredibly grateful for your help and vigilance. If you see any new accounts or content appearing under my name from this day on, please know it isn't from me. Your support in reporting these imposters to the respective platforms would mean the world to me.<br/>
    Thank you so much for your understanding and support.
