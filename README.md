    This should be a very difficult but necessary decision.<br/>
    Starting today, July 30, 2025, I will be stepping back from creating new content on this platform and others for the foreseeable future.<br/>
    The only activity you might see from my account on this platform will be the removal of old forked repositories that I have not personally participated in or contributed to. This is simply part of an effort to clean up my digital footprint.<br/>
    This broader decision to step back comes from a need to prevent my name and username from being used for malicious activities online. By pausing my own content, I hope to make any fraudulent accounts more visible.<br/>
    I would be incredibly grateful for your help and vigilance. If you see any new accounts or content appearing under my name from this day on, please know it isn't from me. Your support in reporting these imposters to the respective platforms would mean the world to me.<br/>
    Thank you so much for your understanding and support.
